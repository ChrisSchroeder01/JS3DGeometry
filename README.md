# JS3DGeometry
This is a little project i made, it is definitely not perfect, it was more a practice of my recently gained knowledge in my studies.

## Plans
- Perspective (Things further away => smaller)
- Add more basic geometric shapes (Pyramide, Cone, Cylinder, Sphere).
- Moving Viewpoint.
- (Not sure if possible) Only drawing visible lines.
